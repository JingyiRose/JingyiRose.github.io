abstract: 'We study the minimum number of distinct distances between point sets on
  two curves in R3. Assume that one curve contains m points and the other n points.
  Our main results: (a) When the curves are conic sections, we characterize all cases
  where the number of distances is O(m+n). This includes new constructions for points
  on two parabolas, two ellipses, and one ellipse and one hyperbola. In all other
  cases, the number of distances is Ω(minm2/3n2/3,m2,n2). (b) When the curves are
  not necessarily algebraic but smooth and contained in perpendicular planes, we characterize
  all cases where the number of distances is O(m+n). This includes a surprising new
  construction of non-algebraic curves that involve logarithms. In all other cases,
  the number of distances is Ω(minm2/3n2/3,m2,n2).'
